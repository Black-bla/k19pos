---

## Priority Order Recommendation:

### **Immediate (Must Have - Week 1):**
1. ‚úÖ Payment Amount Calculation - 30 mins
2. ‚úÖ Lipana Payment Integration - 2-3 hours

---

## Phase 6: Printable Daily Reporting (Kitchen & FOH)

### Objective
Produce printable/PDF daily reports showing all orders, waiters, timing per status, tips, gross sales, COGS, and profit.

### Data & Schema
- Ensure `guest_orders` records status timestamps (pending, preparing, ready, served) or a status history table.
- Add/verify `payments` captures `tip_amount`, `payment_method`, `paid_at`.
- Store `menu_items.cost` (COGS) for profit calc; index key columns (status, created_at, waiter_id).

### Backend/Queries
- Create a reporting view/RPC returning orders for a date range with: waiter, table/guest, item totals, tips, COGS, per-order profit, and status durations.
- Return rollups: per-waiter, per-category, daily totals (gross, tips, COGS, profit, avg service times).

### Frontend UI/Exports
- Add a ‚ÄúDaily Report‚Äù screen (date range picker) that renders summary KPIs + tables (orders, waiters, categories).
- Provide export actions: Print/PDF (expo-print or RN print lib) and CSV.
- Print styling: light background, high contrast, fits A4/Letter.

### Metrics
- Revenue: gross sales, tips, net.
- Profit: (sales + tips) ‚Äì COGS (and fees if applicable).
- Timing: durations between status timestamps; avg service time per order and per waiter.

### Open Questions
- Do we have item COGS already? Are taxes/fees needed? Per-shift vs per-day reports? Tips pooled or per-waiter?
3. ‚úÖ View Existing Orders - 30 mins

### **High Priority (Should Have - Week 2):**
4. ‚úÖ Order Editing/Cancellation - 1-2 hours
5. ‚úÖ Kitchen Screen - 2-3 hours

### **Medium Priority (Nice to Have - Week 3):**
6. ‚úÖ Waiter Filtering - 1 hour
7. ‚úÖ Reservations - 1-2 hours

---

## Technical Considerations:

### Database Schema Updates Needed:
```sql
-- Add status to guest_orders
ALTER TABLE guest_orders 
ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Create payments table if not exists
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  guest_id UUID REFERENCES guests(id),
  phone_number TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  mpesa_receipt_number TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_guest_orders_status ON guest_orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_guest_id ON payments(guest_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_status ON payments(status);
```

### External Services Required:
1. **Lipana (lipana.dev):**
   - API Key (from Lipana dashboard)
   - Webhook URL (for payment confirmations)
   - Handles M-Pesa payments internally
   - No need for direct M-Pesa Daraja API setup
2. **Optional SMS Service:**
   - Africa's Talking or similar
   - For reservation reminders

### Environment Variables Needed:
```
LIPANA_API_KEY=
LIPANA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
LIPANA_CALLBACK_URL=
```
